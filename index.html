<!-- Short introduction -->
      <p >I am Ornela Hunda and this is my Portfolio website.</p>
     <p> I was born in the south of Albania, located in southeastern of Europe. Since a child I was always fascinated by computers
        and technology but also I was very intrigued by the fact that how economy worked in different countries. I continued
        working on my childhood interests, while I pursued an education in Computer Science and Economics, at the University
        of Tirana.
      </p>
      <p>Everyone has a lifetime dream and I have always pictured myself a successful person working in some office in New York.
        This is kind of impossible for a young person raised in Albania, but here I am halfway on my destination. </p>
        <p>Never let
        you dreams die. If you have a heartbeat there is still time to make them come true.
      </p>
